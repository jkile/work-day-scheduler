# work-day-scheduler

This is a simple scheduling app that allows you to write in tasks dedicated to a particular hour of the day. Upon hitting the "save button", the program will log the current tasks into local storage to be recalled on a page refresh. To intialize a text box, you can just clear the text left over, and hit save. Additionally, the color wil change on the areas depending on what time of day it is, highlighting the current hour slot in red, future slots in green, and past slots in grey.

The full application can be found hosted here: https://jkile.github.io/work-day-scheduler/
